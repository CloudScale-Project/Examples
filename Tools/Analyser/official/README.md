==============

To illustrate different features of Palladio, a set of examples is provided. Examples bundle models which test or demonstrate a certain subset of Palladio features. Case studies complement these example and represent more complex objects of study.


We use a convention to decide between test and example projects.

 * Tests are focused on one specific feature and used to test it's correct behaviour (suffixed by '_Test').
 * Examples are representative examples for introducing and learning Palladio functionality (suffixed by '_Example').

The main difference between those types is the quality how intuitive they should be. While tests are intended to be used by developers familar with palladio, examples should be prepared to be used by people which have never used the specific feature before.
